# Image Enhancement Using Python

Image Enhancement can be divided to __Two__ class, the point processing and the histogram processing.

## Point Processing

Six methods are used here, they are:

- Image Negative \
  It's the simplest method to transform image using _point processing_
- Thresholding Transformations \
  set a threshold function
- Logarithmic Transformations \
  do the _Log_ transformation to the image \
  which can widen the image grey level
- Powers-Law Transformations \
  Also be called the famous _Gamma transformation_
- Piecewise Linear Transformation Functions \
  The _enhanced edition_ of Thresholding Transformations

## Histogram Processing

Use histogram to process image.

The most used method is called __histogram equalization__.
